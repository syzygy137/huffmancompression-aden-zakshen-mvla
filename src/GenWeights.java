	 * NOTE: All source text files are located in the data/ directory. You do NOT need to 
	 *       prepend "data/" to the infName - the GUI handles this for you.
	 * 
	 * You should check the file for the following issues (using the getFileStatus method
	 * in MyFileIO) and take the appropriate action if they occur.
	 * 
	 * a) if the filename is empty, raise a WARNING alert with an appropriate message and
	 *    return.
	 * b) if the file does not exist or is empty, raise a WARNING alert with an appropriate 
	 *    message and return.
	 * c) if the file exists and is not empty, but is not readable, raise a WARNING alert with 
	 *    an appropriate message and return.
	 * 
	 * Each of these errors should be differentiated and reported to the user via an alert 
	 * 
	 * Assuming that the requirements of a, b and c have all been met successfully, 
	 * initialize the weights and read the file character by character, incrementing 
	 * weights[character] by one each time. Remember to account for the EOF character 
	 * (ordinal value 0) - this will never be read, but is present at the end of each 
	 * file, so you must increment weights[0] manually (or set to 1).
	 *  
	 * Refer to the HuffAlerts and HuffCompAlerts Classes to understand the alert types
	 * 
	 * Once the input file has been fully processed, you should print the weights to the console.
